## 📋 Prerequisites

<details>
  <summary>🔑 Required accounts and resources</summary>
  
  - Docker and Docker Compose
  - 8x8 Connect Account with:
    - API Key
    - Subaccount ID
    - Virtual Number (for outbound calls)
  - Ngrok account with authtoken and a static domain for local testing
</details>

<details>
  <summary>🔄 Setting Up Ngrok</summary>
  
  This project requires ngrok with a static domain for webhook handling:

  - **Ngrok account**: Sign up at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/signup)
  - **Static domain**: Head over to https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains to create a static domain (Limited to 1 static url for free ngrok accounts)
  - **Authtoken**: Go to https://dashboard.ngrok.com/authtokens to create an authtoken

  While there are alternatives to ngrok, such as:
  - Deploying to a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)
  - Using other tunneling services like [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/)
  - Setting up your own reverse proxy with a static IP

  Please note that this project's Docker configuration, scripts, and overall implementation are specifically designed for ngrok. Using any alternative would require significant changes to the Docker setup, configuration files, and possibly the application code.

##  🚀 Setup Guide

<details>
  <summary>🐳 Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)</summary>
  
  1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/harrism04/voice_restaurant_ivr.git
     cd voice_restaurant_ivr
     ```

  2. Set up environment variables:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
     Edit `.env` and fill in your credentials:
     ```
     EIGHT_X_EIGHT_API_KEY=your_api_key_from_connect_portal
     EIGHT_X_EIGHT_SUBACCOUNT_ID=your_subaccount_id
     OUTBOUND_PHONE_NUMBER=your_virtual_number  # Must be in international format e.g for SG +6591234567
     WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN=your_randomly_generated_webhook_auth_token
     WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=your_static_ngrok_domain  # e.g., https://your-domain.ngrok-free.app
     NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your_ngrok_authtoken
     ```
     Note: The `OUTBOUND_PHONE_NUMBER` is used as the source number for all outbound calls. It must be a valid 8x8 virtual number configured in your account. Reach out to cpaas-support@8x8.com or your account manager if unsure.

  3. Configure your static ngrok domain:
     - Go to https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains to find your static ngrok domain or create one if you haven't already.
     - Update `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` in your `.env` file with your static ngrok domain.
     - Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and update the `--domain` parameter in the `NGROK_OPTS` environment variable with your static domain:
       ```yaml
       - 'NGROK_OPTS=--log=stdout --domain=your-domain.ngrok-free.app'
       ```
     
     Note: The ngrok configuration is automatically generated inside the container, so you don't need to manually create or edit an ngrok.yml file.

  4. Configure webhooks in 8x8 Connect console or [via API](https://developer.8x8.com/connect/reference/create-a-new-webhook):
     - VCA Webhook URL: `{WEBHOOK_BASE_URL}/api/webhooks/vca`
     - VSS Webhook URL: `{WEBHOOK_BASE_URL}/api/webhooks/vss` 

  5. Start the application:
     ```bash
     # For first time setup, use --build flag
     docker-compose up -d --build
     
     # For subsequent starts
     docker-compose up -d
     ```
     
     To check the status of your services:
     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```
     
     To view the ngrok tunnel URL:
     ```bash
     curl -s http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels | grep -o '"public_url":"[^"]*' | grep -o 'http[^"]*'
     ```
     
     To stop the services:
     ```bash
     docker-compose down
     ```

  The application is now ready to handle calls!

  <summary>⚙️ Manual Installation (Alternative)</summary>
  
  If you prefer not to use Docker, you can install the application manually:

  1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/harrism04/voice_restaurant_ivr.git
     cd voice_restaurant_ivr
     ```

  2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

  3. Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

  4. Set up environment variables:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
     Edit `.env` and fill in your credentials:
     ```
     EIGHT_X_EIGHT_API_KEY=your_api_key_from_connect_portal
     EIGHT_X_EIGHT_SUBACCOUNT_ID=your_subaccount_id
     OUTBOUND_PHONE_NUMBER=your_virtual_number  # Must be in international format e.g for SG +6591234567
     WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN=your_randomly_generated_webhook_auth_token
     WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=your_static_ngrok_domain  # e.g., https://your-domain.ngrok-free.app
     NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your_ngrok_authtoken
     ```
     Note: The `OUTBOUND_PHONE_NUMBER` is used as the source number for all outbound calls. It must be a valid 8x8 virtual number configured in your account.

  5. Configure your static ngrok domain:
     - Go to https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains to find your static ngrok domain or create one if you haven't already.
     - Update `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` in your `.env` file with your static ngrok domain.

  6. Configure webhooks in 8x8 Connect console:
     - VCA Webhook URL: `{WEBHOOK_BASE_URL}/api/webhooks/vca`
     - VSS Webhook URL: `{WEBHOOK_BASE_URL}/api/webhooks/vss`
     
     Configure authentication as described in the Docker setup section (step 4).

  7. Set up ngrok configuration:
     Create a file named `ngrok.yml` with the following content, or simply copy ngrok.yml.example:
     ```yaml
     version: 2
     authtoken: your_ngrok_authtoken
     web_addr: 0.0.0.0:4040
     tunnels:
       http:
         addr: 5678
         proto: http
         domain: your-static-domain.ngrok-free.app  # Use your static domain here
         basic_auth:
           - "admin:your_webhook_auth_token"  # Same as WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN in .env
     ```

  8. Start ngrok to create a tunnel for webhooks:
     ```bash
     # Start ngrok with the configuration file
     ngrok start --config ngrok.yml http
     ```
     This command starts the tunnel named "http" defined in your configuration file.
     
     Verify that ngrok is using your static domain by checking the output. You should see a line like:
     ```
     started tunnel http -> http://localhost:5678
     url: https://your-static-domain.ngrok-free.app
     ```

  9. Start the FastAPI server:
     ```bash
     python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 5678
     ```

## 💻 Making a Test Call

<details>
  <summary>🧪 Testing with cURL</summary>
  
Use curl or any API client to make a test call. First, create a Base64 encoded string of `admin:your_webhook_auth_token`:

  ```bash
  # On Mac/Linux
  echo -n "admin:your_webhook_auth_token" | base64

  # On Windows PowerShell
  [Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes("admin:your_webhook_auth_token"))
  ```

Then use the encoded string in your API call:
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:5678/api/make-call' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_STRING' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "orderId": "APT123",
    "customerPhone": "+6591234567",
    "businessName": "Business Name",
    "appointmentTime": "2025-04-20T19:30:00Z"
}'
```

Example:
- If your `WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN` is `secret123`
- Base64 encode `admin:secret123` → `YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0MTIz`
- Use `Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0MTIz` in the header

Note: The call will be made from the OUTBOUND_PHONE_NUMBER specified in your .env file
